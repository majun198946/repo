Description: this package isn't described yet
 This package, which I'm certain is incredibly interesting, has yet to
 be described. This is probably because Jay has spent days getting all
 kinds of bookkeeping issues, like copyright notifications, all in their
 correct places, and descriptions just aren't the most important thing
 he could be working on. If this is a problem, please come back later.
